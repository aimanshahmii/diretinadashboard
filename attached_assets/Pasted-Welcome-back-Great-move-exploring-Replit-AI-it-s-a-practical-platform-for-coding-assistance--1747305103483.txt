Welcome back! Great move exploring **Replit AI** — it's a practical platform for coding assistance, and having a clear, detailed system description will help it generate code that fits your project.

Here’s a **complete, well-structured description** of your system that you can give to Replit AI or any other AI assistant to help you build your Interactive DiRetina Dashboard.

## 📝 **Full Description of the System: Interactive DiRetina Dashboard**

### 📌 **Project Title:**

**Interactive DiRetina Dashboard for Visualizing Eye Disease Prevalence and Risk Factors Using Fundus Imaging Data**

---

### 🎯 **Goal of the System:**

To build a web-based dashboard that:

1. Uses a **trained AI model** (DiRetina) to detect **myopia** and other eye diseases from fundus images.
2. Allows **users (healthcare professionals, educators, policymakers)** to:

   * Upload fundus images
   * View AI-based diagnosis (myopia or normal)
   * See visualized trends, heatmaps, or summary cards (e.g., detection count, eye health score)
3. Supports data-driven decisions for public health.

---

### 🧠 **AI Model Functionality:**

* Built using **TensorFlow and Keras**.
* Takes **fundus images** as input (RGB images resized to 224x224).
* Outputs binary classification:

  * **1** = Myopia
  * **0** = Normal
* Can be trained using labeled data stored in folders or from a CSV file.

---

### 📂 **Dataset Structure:**

* Contains **training** and **testing** folders.
* A separate **`labels.csv`** file maps image filenames to labels:

  ```
  Filename,Label
  image1.jpg,1
  image2.jpg,0
  ```

---

### 💻 **System Components:**

#### 1. **Backend**

* Python-based using:

  * TensorFlow/Keras for AI model
  * OpenCV for image processing
  * Pandas/NumPy for data handling
* Supports:

  * Image upload and preprocessing
  * Prediction using a trained model
  * Option to retrain model if needed

#### 2. **Frontend Dashboard (to build in future)**

* Can be built using **Streamlit** or **Dash/Plotly**
* Displays:

  * Upload button for new images
  * Prediction results (e.g., “Myopia detected”)
  * Visual charts (bar chart, heatmap)
  * Summary cards (e.g., total images, myopia cases, normal cases)

---

### 📊 **Planned Visual Elements:**

* Line chart showing myopia cases over time
* Pie chart of detected myopia vs normal
* Heatmap for high-risk zones (optional for advanced stage)
* Summary cards like:

  * Images uploaded
  * Eye disease detected
  * Eye health score

---

### 🔒 **Assumptions & Considerations:**

* Images are pre-labeled (or labeled by user manually)
* Dataset is small enough to train locally (or loaded from Google Drive/Kaggle)
* AI model should be able to make predictions with reasonable accuracy
* The dashboard must be **easy to use** and **mobile-friendly** for stakeholders

---

### 🛠️ **Technologies Preferred:**

* **Python** for backend logic
* **TensorFlow / Keras** for model
* **OpenCV** for image processing
* **Pandas / NumPy** for data manipulation
* **Streamlit or Dash** for frontend
* **Matplotlib / Plotly** for visualizations

### 📁 **Project Folder Example:**

```
/project_root/
│── train/
│── test/
│── labels.csv
│── ai_model.py
│── dashboard.py (to be built)
```

---

### ✅ **Key Features to Build (MVP - Minimum Viable Product):**

1. Load images and labels from folder and CSV
2. Preprocess images (resize, normalize)
3. Train a simple CNN model
4. Predict new images
5. Print results in command line or show in basic UI
